- **Strength**: 40%
- **Direction**: long
- **Rationale**: Flat skew (absolute): 0.0% <= threshold 2.0%. Using fallback (insufficient history).

### 💡 AAPL - skew_extreme

- **Rationale**: Flat skew (absolute): 0.5% <= threshold 2.0%. Using fallback (insufficient history).

### 💡 AAPL - vrp

## Edge Explanation: SKEW_EXTREME

### Trigger Facts
- **25-delta Skew**: 0.0%
- **Historical Percentile**: 0th

### Why This Edge Exists
**Why this edge exists:** Options skew (the price difference between puts and calls)
reflects fear and positioning. Extreme skew often overshoots fair value due to hedging
demand or retail speculation. When skew hits historical extremes, it tends to mean-revert
as the catalyst passes or positioning unwinds.

### What Could Go Wrong
- **Tail risk materializes** — the fear priced into skew was justified
- **Trend continuation** — skew was cheap because downside keeps going
- **Skew re-rates** — new information makes extreme skew the new normal

### Regime Fit
**Fit: NEUTRAL** (regime confidence: 50%)

Regime has no strong bias for this edge type.

## Trade Explanation: DEBIT_SPREAD

### Why This Structure
**Why this structure:** A debit spread defines risk for a directional bet.
You pay a premium but cap your loss. Ideal when you have conviction on direction
but want to limit exposure.

### Risk Math
```
Account Equity:           $100,000
Risk Budget (1%):         $1,000
Max Loss per Contract:    $34

Calculation:
  floor(1,000 / 34) = 2 contracts

Recommended Contracts:    2
Total Risk:               $67
Risk % of Equity:         0.07%
```

### Pricing Assumptions
- **Entry Target**: $34 debit (mid price)
- **Conservative Debit**: Uses ask for longs, bid for shorts
- **Risk Calculation**: Based on conservative (worst-case) fill
- **Risk/Reward Ratio**: 7.95:1
- **Breakevens**: $246.66

### Monitoring & Exit Plan
**Suggested Targets:**
- Take Profit: 50-100% of max profit ($133-$266)
- Stop Loss: 50% of debit paid
- Time Stop: Manage near expiration (gamma risk)

**Do Not Trade If:**
- Quote is invalid (bid=0 or bid > ask)
- Bid-ask spread > 5% of mid
- Open interest < 500 contracts
- After-hours/pre-market (stale quotes)

**Monitor:**
- IV changes (vol expansion hurts short premium)
- Spot price vs short strikes (delta blowup)
- Regime indicators (VIX spike, trend break)
- Gamma as expiration approaches
